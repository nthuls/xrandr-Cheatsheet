   Ensure the appropriate kernel modules for your Intel audio device are loaded.

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel
   ```

2. **Check ALSA for Recognized Devices**:
   List the ALSA sound devices to see if your hardware is detected.

   ```bash
   aplay -l
   ```

   You should see your Intel audio device listed. If not, there might be a problem with the driver.

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have installed the necessary audio packages.

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S alsa-utils alsa-plugins pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa pavucontrol
   ```

4. **Unmute Audio Channels with ALSA**:
   Open the ALSA mixer and ensure that all channels are unmuted.

   ```bash
   alsamixer
   ```

   Use the arrow keys to navigate and press `M` to unmute channels.

5. **Check PulseAudio**:
   Ensure PulseAudio is running and configured correctly.

   ```bash
   pulseaudio --start
   pavucontrol
   ```

   In `pavucontrol`, ensure the correct output device is selected in the "Output Devices" tab.

6. **Check Kernel Logs for Errors**:
   Look for any audio-related errors in the kernel logs.

   ```bash
   dmesg | grep snd
   ```

7. **Update ALSA Configuration**:
   Sometimes, updating the ALSA configuration can help.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
   ```

   Add the following line to the file:

   ```plaintext
   options snd-hda-intel model=auto
   ```

   Save and exit the file, then reboot your system.

8. **Install `sof-firmware` (if necessary)**:
   Some Intel audio devices require the `sof-firmware` package.

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S sof-firmware
   ```

### Reboot Your System
After making these changes, reboot your system to ensure all configurations take effect.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

# What I did next 

The output indicates that only your NVIDIA HDMI audio devices are being detected, not the Intel audio device. This could mean the Intel audio device is not being recognized or is not configured correctly. Let's try some additional steps to resolve this.

### Step-by-Step Fixes

1. **Ensure Intel Audio Module is Loaded**

   Verify that the Intel audio module is loaded:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep snd_hda_intel
   ```

   If you don't see `snd_hda_intel` listed, try loading it manually:
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel
   ```

2. **Force Reload ALSA**
   
   Reload ALSA to ensure all audio devices are recognized:
   ```bash
   sudo alsa force-reload
   ```

3. **Update Initramfs**
   
   Sometimes updating the initramfs can help:
   ```bash
   sudo mkinitcpio -P
   ```

4. **Blacklist NVIDIA HDMI Audio**
   
   If you are not using the HDMI audio from the NVIDIA card, you can try blacklisting it to force the system to use the Intel audio device:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
   ```

   Add the following lines to the file:
   ```plaintext
   blacklist snd_hda_codec_hdmi
   ```

   Save and exit, then reboot your system:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

5. **Install and Configure `sof-firmware`**
   
   Ensure `sof-firmware` is installed:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S sof-firmware
   ```

6. **Verify Audio Device Recognition**
   
   After rebooting, check if the Intel audio device is now recognized:
   ```bash
   aplay -l
   ```

7. **PulseAudio Configuration**

   Restart PulseAudio and ensure the correct device is selected:
   ```bash
   pulseaudio --start
   pavucontrol
   ```

8. **Check Kernel Logs for Errors**

   Look for any relevant error messages in the kernel logs:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep snd
   ```

### Verify and Test Audio

After performing these steps, check again if your Intel audio device is detected and if the audio is working. If it still doesn't work, provide the outputs of the following commands for further analysis:
- `lsmod | grep snd`
- `dmesg | grep snd`
- `aplay -l`
- `pacmd list-sinks`


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT WORKED 

Since the `alsa` command is not available on Arch Linux, let's proceed with alternative methods to troubleshoot and manually get the audio working while ensuring the HDMI audio remains functional.

### Verify and Configure Audio Devices

1. **Check if the Intel Audio Device is Recognized:**

   Since `snd_hda_intel` is loaded, let's ensure the Intel audio device is recognized by the system.

   ```bash
   sudo lspci -v | grep -A7 -i "audio"
   ```

2. **Create or Update ALSA Configuration:**

   Let's create or update the ALSA configuration to explicitly specify the Intel audio device and keep HDMI functional.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
   ```

   Add or update the following lines to specify the model and ensure HDMI is enabled:
   
   ```plaintext
   options snd-hda-intel index=0,1
   options snd-hda-intel id=Intel,HDMI
   options snd-hda-intel model=auto
   ```

   Save and exit the file, then reboot your system.

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

3. **Check PulseAudio Configuration:**

   After rebooting, start PulseAudio and open its volume control interface:

   ```bash
   pulseaudio --start
   pavucontrol
   ```

   Ensure the correct output devices are selected in the "Output Devices" and "Playback" tabs.

4. **Verify Audio Devices:**

   Check again if the Intel audio device and HDMI audio are recognized:

   ```bash
   aplay -l
   ```

   You should see both Intel and HDMI audio devices listed.

5. **Install `sof-firmware` (if necessary):**

   Ensure the `sof-firmware` package is installed, as it may be required for some Intel audio devices:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S sof-firmware
   ```

### Manual Audio Playback Test

You can manually test audio playback using `aplay` and `speaker-test`:

1. **Test with `aplay`:**

   Play a test sound on the Intel audio device (adjust card and device numbers as needed):

   ```bash
   aplay -D plughw:0,0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
   ```

2. **Test with `speaker-test`:**

   Run a speaker test on the Intel audio device:

   ```bash
   speaker-test -D plughw:0,0 -c 2
   ```

   Run a speaker test on the HDMI audio device:

   ```bash
   speaker-test -D plughw:0,3 -c 2
   ```

### Check Kernel Logs for Errors

If you encounter any issues, check the kernel logs for audio-related errors:

```bash
dmesg | grep snd
```

### Further Analysis

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, please provide the outputs of the following commands for further analysis:
- `lsmod | grep snd`
- `dmesg | grep snd`
- `aplay -l`
- `pacmd list-sinks`

These detailed outputs will help identify if there are any specific errors or misconfigurations.
